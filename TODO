Remove all the pointers in diagram_t so that the object is easily copyable!

This chemical potential obviously needs to be chosen below E0(k), otherwise mostly large Ï diagrams will be generated, and the statistics at small Ï will be poor, leading to an inaccurate normalization.

Check when is appropriate to replace gsl_rng_uniform() with gsl_rng_uniform_pos()
